## What I do

I make work about human irrationality, usually in confrontation with logical systems. 

## What You'll Find Here
My favorite medium is the esolang: programming language design as a means of expression and experimentation. A few examples:

* <a href="https://github.com/rottytooth/Folders">Folders</a> (2015), where code is written only in the combination of folders within folders, ignoring files and text
 
* <a href="https://github.com/rottytooth/FatFingerJS">FatFinger</a> (2017), a dialect of JavaScript that forgives, and encourages, typos and misspellings

* <a href="https://github.com/rottytooth/Entropy">Entropy</a> (2010), where data decays the more it is used, with programs that slowly slip out of the programmer's control

* <a href="https://github.com/rottytooth/Olympus">Olympus</a> (2022), where we code in incantations to the gods -- a language that better reflects the actual power dynamic of programmer and machine

* <a href="https://github.com/rottytooth/Time-Out">Time Out</a> (2015), where code is written in the increments of time that lines of code in another language take to run

* There are many more, some public here already, others to release with my book in late 2025
